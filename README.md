# Blackjack


To run the program, javac everything in the Blackjack/Primary folder and use "java CasinoGui".

In this program, we will be attempting to run a game of Blackjack. The main purpose of Blackjack is to draw cards to get as close as you can to the number 21, without going over 21. 


When you run the program, you will be greeted by the Board. 
As a player, you will start with 50 dollars, and your stats are labeled by the labels towards the bottom and to the right of the screen. 
The Labels for "Cards" show the cards in you and your dealer's respective hands. 
The labels for "Total Card Value" shows the added values of all the cards in each player's respective hands.

To start a new game, you must click the "Start Game" button, where you will be prompted to input a name for yourself. 

To start a new round, you must click the "New Round" button, which begins the new round by prompting you to take display an amount that you wish to bet.

The game will then begin, with the Dealer each dealing two cards to himself and to you. 

You can then choose to hit, stand, or Double Down.

Hit-This makes you take another card from the Deck. If you bust(go over 21) , a message will pop up informing you that you have done so, and you will lose the round. 

Stand- This ends your turn by telling that you don't wish to draw any more cards, and are satisfied with the value you currently have. 

Double Down-This can be played after you've gotten your two initial cards. This forces you to take one card and stand(making it so you cannot draw any more cards. The plus side of this, is this allows you to double your bet, even after you've seen your first two cards.   

There is a rule that works behind the scenes called "Five Card Charlie" which states that if you can draw 5 cards without busting, then you automatically win the round. 

When you Lose, your bet gets subtracted from your total amount of money. 

When you win, you get double your bet back. 

Once you have either lost or won, you can choose new Round to start a new round of Blackjack, while keeping all of your money and stats.
